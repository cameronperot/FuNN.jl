I recently took the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization taught by Andrew Ng and found it to be a great series of courses.
After learning a lot more about how artificial neural networks work I decided writing my own would be a good way to solidify my knowledge.
The basic binary classifier works and can be trained using optimization techniques such gradient descent with momentum or Adam.
Documentation will be added at a later point.
